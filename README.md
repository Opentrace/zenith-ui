# Zenith UI
Styled UI components for [React][react]

This is very much still in development. It's obvious looking at the code that it doesn't do anything yet. It will soon.

## Usage
Documentation coming...eventually.

## Components
As components are added they will be checked off this list. That doesn't mean they're "done", it just means that a functional version exists. They may be expanded on later. More components may be added to this list. This is really just a guideline for us to follow while we build things. We'll most likely add components as we need them in other projects.
